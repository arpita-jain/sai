**HOW TO**

Check the new "Function and Shortcode Editor" in Tools section.

When you insert a banner you can assign it to a group (or key). In this way, for example, if your theme layout is a 3 columns, you can insert in left sidebar:

`<?php if(function_exists( 'wp_bannerize' ))
          wp_bannerize('group=left_sidebar'); ?>`

in right sidebar:

`<?php if(function_exists( 'wp_bannerize' ))
          wp_bannerize('group=right_sidebar'); ?>`

In addition WP Bannerize provides a filter by category, for example:

`<?php if(function_exists( 'wp_bannerize' ))
          wp_bannerize('group=right_sidebar&categories=13,14'); ?>`

The code above shows banners only for the categories 13 or 14, for the "right_sidebar" group key.

or in your post:

`[wp_bannerize group="adv" random="1" limit="3"]`

The default HTML output for above code is:

`<div class="wp_bannerize adv">
  <div>
    <a href=".."><img src="..." /></a>
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href=".."><img src="..." /></a>
    <div class="description">[description]</div>
  </div>
  ...
</div>
`

**params:**

`
* group               If '' show all groups, else show the selected group code (default '')
* no_html_wrap        Display only link and image tag, No WP Bannerize wrap HTML (default '')
* random              Show random banner sequence (default '')
* categories          Category ID separated by commas. (default '')
* limit               Limit rows number (default '' - show all rows)
* before              HTML Tag before banner (default '<div>')
* after               HTML Tag after banner (default '</div>')

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= Can I customize the HTML output? =

Yes, first check the 'Settings' in admin area, or use a custom CSS rules.
For example the default WP Bannerize output is:

`
<div class="wp_bannerize">
  <div>
    <a href=".."><img src="..." /></a>
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href=".."><img src="..." /></a>
    <div class="description">[description]</div>
  </div>
 ...
</div>`

If you use a group key named "network", for example:

`
<div class="wp_bannerize network">
  <div>
    <a href=".."><img src="..." /></a>
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href=".."><img src="..." /></a>
    <div class="description">[description]</div>
  </div>
 ...
</div>`
