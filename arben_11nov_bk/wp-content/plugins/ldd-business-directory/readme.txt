Create a directory of businesses and listings for your WordPress website.

== Description ==

The LDD Business Directory plugin allows a user to easily manage and display businesses and/or listings along with their information on a WordPress website. Simply using the shortcode `[business_directory]` on any WordPress page will display the directory as well as allow visitors to search through the directory and submit a business or listing of their own.

For users that have a listing on the directory, they can easily sign in and edit their information through the *Login* feature. From the WordPress administration it is easy to categorize businesses and listings, edit their information, and add any custom information fields that site administrator may want to include.

If there are any questions or concerns feel free to contact us at the [LDD Business Directory homepage](http://www.lddwebdesign.com/ldd-web-design-featured-projects/ldd-business-directory-plugin/ "LDD Web Design - LDD Business Directory").

== Installation ==

1. Install from the WordPress plugins utility or simply upload the `ldd-business-directory` folder to your plugins directory (`/wp-content/plugins`).
2. Make sure you activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' page from the menu in WordPress.
3. Now you should have a `Directory` menu item on your dashboard.
4. From here you can alter your settings, add listings, edit listing information, approve user submitted listings, remove listings, and create categories.
5. Decide which page you wish to display it on or create a page and enter the shortcode `[business_directory]` in the content area of your page.
6. You can also use the PHP function `<?php display_business_directory(); ?>` directly in your template file.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. Nothing is displayed when I click on a business entry! How can I fix this? =
A. Try changing your Permalink settings to *Post name* and refresh your page.

= Q. Does the Login feature connect with my Wordpress login? =
A. No. It is strictly used for the *Business Directory* and is for those who have submitted a business listing and would like to make changes to their directory entry.

= Q. I would like to use this plugin for community organizations but need to change the text in places where it says business. Is this possible? =
A. There is a text field on the Settings page called `Directory Label` where you can change this text.

= Q. The same image is being displayed across all the listings, why is this? =
A. The filename of the logo used for each listing is based upon the *login name* that has been entered for each individual listing. If all the listings have no login then whatever logo has been uploaded for any one of them will be applied to all of them (same goes if multiple listings have the same login). Each listing should have a unique login. *(Changed in version 1.3.10 to use the **Listing Name**)*
