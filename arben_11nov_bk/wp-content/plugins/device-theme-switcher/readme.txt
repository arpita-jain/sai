== Description ==

Device Theme Switcher is a WordPress plugin which delivers one of your WordPress themes to handheld visitors and another theme to tablet visitors. Computer visitors are given the active theme in 'Appearance > Themes'.

== Installation ==

= How to Install = 

Install and activate in your WordPress 'Plugins > Add New' section by searching for 'Device Theme Switcher', or download the plugin zip (Big orange button up and to the right which says 'Download Version 2.0') and upload it manually in the 'WordPress Plugins > Add New > Upload' section. After activation you'll have a new menu: 'Appearance > Device Themes'-where you set which theme is given to which visitor device.

= URL Switching - NEW in Version 2.0! =

Your device themes can be easily accessed to 'test' and see what other devices see.

`www.mywebsite.com/?theme=handheld
www.mywebsite.com/?theme=tablet
www.mywebsite.com/?theme=low_support
www.mywebsite.com/?theme=active`

= Template Tags, Shortcodes, and Widgets - NEW in Version 2.0! =

Template Tags, Shortcodes, and Widgets all output a simple HTML anchor tag which links to the mobile/active theme for the website by using URL Switching (See Above). 

Template tags can be used in any theme or plugin file. Shortcodes can be used in the content of any post, page, or custom-post-type.

`//Template Tag - Display a link to 'View Full Website'
<?php link_to_full_website($link_text = "View Full Website", $css_classes = array('blue-text', 'alignleft'), $echo = true) ?>

//Shortcode - Display a link to 'View Full Website'
[link_to_full_website link_text="View Full Website" css_classes="blue-text, alignleft"]`

`//Template Tag - Display a link to 'Return to Mobile Website'
<?php link_back_to_device($link_text = "Return to Mobile Website", $css_classes = array('red-text', 'alignright'), $echo = true) ?>

//Shortcode -  - Display a link to 'Return to Mobile Website'
[link_back_to_device link_text="Return to Mobile Website" css_classes="red-text, alignright"]`

The anchor tags that output have a CSS class of 'dts-link'. The 'View Full Website' anchor tag also has a class of 'to-full-website' and the 'Return to the Mobile Website' link has an additional class of 'back-to-mobile'. This CSS can be used anywhere in your theme or style.css file. 

Link Styling Example (For Tempalte Tags, Widgets, or Shortcodes): 

`<style type="text/css">
    .dts-link {
        font-size: 1.5em ;
    }
        .dts-link.to-full-website {
            color: red ;
        }
        .dts-link.back-to-mobile {
            color: blue ;
        }
</style>`

= $dts global - NEW in Version 2.0! =

The $dts global contains all the run-time device theme switcher settings and the current visitor device. You can access the $dts global anywhere in your theme or plugin.

`<?php 
    //Access the device theme switcher object anywhere in your theme or plugin
    global $dts
    
    //use it..
    if ($dts->device == 'tablet') do_something() ;

    //See what's in there..
    print_r($dts) ;

        [theme_override] => tablet (Possible Values: See Above)(Explanation: I'm on a computer, so my device is 'active' [I get the active theme] and I used a URL parameter [site.com?theme=tablet] to view the tablet theme)
    )
?>`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which devices are considered 'handheld' and which are 'tablet'? =
'Handheld' devices include Android, BlackBerry, iPod, iPhone, Windows Mobile, and other various 'hand held' smart phones. 'Tablet' devices include iPad, Android tablets, Kindle Fire and other large-screen hand helds. 'Low Support' devices include those which have poor CSS & Javascript rendering capabilities-often these are older devices.

= Are WordPress child themes supported? =
Yes!

= Help!? My theme isn't working! = 
If your theme does not work as expected on any of the devices-**the issue is with the theme, NOT with the plugin!** Follow [typical WordPress debugging practices](http://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_in_WordPress) to find and correct the issue in your theme (Or possibly another plugin). The only theme-requirement this plugin relies on is that you have [properly-written WordPress themes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Theme_Development_Standards). If your theme activates in Appearance > Themes and you can preview the theme in your computer's browser-then it is 'properly-written' as far as Device Theme Switcher is concerned.

= How do Menus and Widgets work?! =
All Device Theme Switcher really does is change which theme is delivered to the visitor based on the deivce they're using-*but WordPress still thinks the active theme is 'active' the whole time*. This means you need to have your `register_nav_menu()` or `register_widget()` functions in all your themes! See below for details and examples.

= How do I show the same menu in each theme? =
Simply place you register_nav_menu('my-menu-location', 'My Menu Location Name'); function in both of your primary/active and handheld/tablet theme functions.php files. Then, while your primary theme is 'active' go into Appearance > Menus-create your menu and assign it to the menu location-and populate it with some menu items. That's it!

= How do I show one menu in my active theme and a different menu in my handheld/tablet theme? =
Register a menu location for each theme, and place your register_nav_menus() code in each theme. E.g.:

In each theme's functions.php file:

`register_nav_menus(array(
    'active-menu-location' => 'Active Theme Menu Location',
    'handheld-menu-location' => 'Handheld Theme Menu Location',
    'tablet-menu-location' => 'Tablet Theme Menu Location',
));`

Then, while your primary theme is 'active' go into Appearance > Menus-create your 3 menus-assign each one to their designated menu location-and populate each with some menu items. 

Lastly we just need to display each menu in each theme:

Active theme header.php:
`wp_nav_menu(array('theme_location' => 'active-menu-location'));`

Handheld theme header.php
`wp_nav_menu(array('theme_location' => 'handheld-menu-location'));`

Tablet theme header.php
`wp_nav_menu(array('theme_location' => 'tablet-menu-location'));`

That's it-the important part is that you register each location in each theme!

= How can I display the same sidebar in each theme? =

Place the same register_sidebar() function in each theme's functions.php file, and add your widgets to your sidebar while the primary theme is 'active'.

= How can I display a different sidebar in each theme? =

Place the same 3 register_sidebar() functions in each theme's functions.php file, and add your widgets to each sidebar while the primary theme is 'active'. E.g:

In each theme's functions.php file:

`register_sidebar(array('name' => 'Active Theme Sidebar'));
register_sidebar(array('name' => 'Handheld Theme Sidebar'));
register_sidebar(array('name' => 'Tablet Theme Sidebar'));`

Then, while your primary theme is 'active' go into Appearance > Widgets-and assign some widgets to each sidebar. Lastly we just need to display each sidebar in each theme:

Active theme page.php:
`dynamic_sidebar('Active Theme Sidebar');`

Handheld theme page.php
`dynamic_sidebar('Handheld Theme Sidebar');`

Tablet theme page.php
`dynamic_sidebar('Tablet Theme Sidebar');`
