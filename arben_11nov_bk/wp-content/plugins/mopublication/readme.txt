== Instructions for use ==

Once you've installed the MoPublication plugin for WordPress, you can start building
and customizing your app by moving between the following sidebar tabs:

= 1. Customize =

These are the basic settings for your app

Make sure you fill out all of the fields on this tab - they're all mandatory. Read the help text below each field if you require any assistance.

Tip: Click on the 'Save Changes' button regularly (top right) to ensure that all your changes are saved correctly.

= 2. Content Management =

Select all the content and sections for your app 

Drag and drop the Category Menu and Pages to reorder the navigation

Tip: To ensure that your website content displays optimally in your app, you should add Mobile Featured Images as well as Mobile Video and Audio where applicable. Make use of the custom fields which MoPublication adds underneath your posts in WordPress.

= 3. Third-Party Integration =

Account settings for integration with third-party services 

This is useful for tracking app usage and social sharing. You can also configure advertising options for monetizing your app.

Tip: MoPublication uses the built-in WordPress media library to handle image uploads. When adding images using the pop-up, first use the “From Computer” tab to upload, then find the uploaded image under the “Media Library” tab, and click on “Show” next to the image. Finally, make sure that the “Full Size” option is selected, and click on the “Insert into Post” button to use the image you’ve uploaded.

= 4. Advanced =

Optional settings for the App Store

This is an optional tab where you can configure settings relating to how your app is classified in the App Store (country settings, content classifications, and age restrictions). 

Note: If you don’t make any changes default settings will be used

= 5. Finished! =

Once you're happy with how your app is configured and displays in the live preview, you can move to the final tab and hit the submit button.

You'll be taken to a MoPublication subscription form which you need to complete before your app is submitted to us. 

Once you’ve completed the subscription form, you will be directed to PayPal to complete the payment process. 

After your order is finalized, we'll build your app and send you an email once it’s live in the App Store. This process typically takes 5-10 working days but actual times may vary.
