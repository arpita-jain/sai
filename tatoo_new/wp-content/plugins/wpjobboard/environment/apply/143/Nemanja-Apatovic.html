        <i>I&#039;m experienced in all types of tattoos, but I always want more from myself. Ready for new experiences and challenges, and that&#039;s what drives me, and without which I can&#039;t improve. I enjoy working and talking with customers, and I am very friendly and good-mood. I have no problems with behavior, alcohol and drugs. I want to build a better career and so far I&#039;m happy with my progress</i>
