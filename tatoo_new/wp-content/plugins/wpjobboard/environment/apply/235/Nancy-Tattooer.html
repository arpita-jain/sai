        <strong>Love custom work. Am available for Guest Spots</strong>
        <i>I am tattooing since 2008. For me it&#039;s a passion that&#039;s all comsuming and always on my mind. I am striving to make a beautiful piece of art and feel inspired by my clients who give me the input to create something. It&#039;s a combination between art and the technical possiblities which make it both an artistic and practical process, which I enjoy tremendously.
Not only designing a tattoo, but also the tattoing itself it something very precious to me. The client has to give you so much trust to be tattooed, which make me grateful for it. Whenever there&#039;s the perfect combination between a confinding client, a nice idea and good design, I feel what it is to be a tattooer and why this is a passion and not a job.</i>
