        <strong>usa tattooist seeking guest/permanent positions abroad</strong>
        <i>I prefer creating dotwork and black and grey tattoos but I can accomplish color as well as different styles.
Always my priority is to make nice tattooing and help people feel happy.
I draw and create art everyday.
Other than tattooing, I enjoy sailing and playing the guitar.
I am a native english speaker with some skills in spanish, but I can and will learn any language needed to communicate.
Hard drug free.
Countries I have traveled to recently: Italy, the Netherlands, France, Japan, Puerto Rico, and Antigua. </i>
