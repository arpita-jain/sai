        <strong>Hard Working, Motivated, Responsible</strong>
        <i> my name is nick, I have been tattooing for 8 years, and I am looking for work. 
I have 5 children and live in a smaller town in California which is flooded with shops and very little money. I would love to tattoo in a busy shop as a guest and save money to take home or send home if stay is longer. I am a hard worker and someone you can rely on/ very easy going and drug and drama free. you can view my portfolio at www.tattoosbynick.webs.com 
I look forward to hearing from someone that can use my help. please don&#039;t BS and no unestablished shops please. please respond via email, text or phone call.
