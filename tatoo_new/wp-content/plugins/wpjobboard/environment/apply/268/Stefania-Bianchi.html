        <strong>A tattoo artist with the passion for comics :)</strong>
        <i>I&#039;m an italian tattoo artist with two years of experience at first and actually in a studio in Italy, called Absolution Tattoolounge, where I work with very great people; then I have the fortune to know one of the best known in Italy in japanese and I could be in his studio to see him work for some times. My master teach me to try do all the style at the best...and to learn everything, because it&#039;s the most important thing. Of course because of my passion for comics, anime, manga, ect, I prefer to do cartoon style, and I hope to specialized in this style.
I want to have some new experience with other artist around the world, to increase my ability and to stay with different people  :)
