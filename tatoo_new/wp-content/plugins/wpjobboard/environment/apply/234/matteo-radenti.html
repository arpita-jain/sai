        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <div class="wpjb-job-text">currently working at B52 Tattoo studio, in Berlin, and occasionally in Italy, my homeland. i'm looking forward to travel in europe for short periods, as a guest artist, in order to meet other artists and learn more. <br />
I'm a skilled drawer, already active in comic books and illustration. i have a sketchy, nervous kind of touch, love deep shadings and i tend to work more black and gray, or just definitely black, rather than colours. <br />
I'm fast and reliable, always paying attention to the customer's needs. I'm clean and drug free, although i can appreciate gallons of beer in the weekend.</div>
