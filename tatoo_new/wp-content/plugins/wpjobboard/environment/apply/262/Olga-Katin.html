        <strong>Hard working and dedicated, love drawing and tattooing!!!</strong>
        <i>I have about 6 years studio experience, and besides that i have a degree at graphic design.
I love to draw my own designs and always will prefer to do custom work. 
I love skulls, skeletons, punk and comics, but can handle realistic work well.
At the last period I&#039;m traveling and looking for new opportunities.
Most of the time im interested and available to do guest spots, UK or Europe.</i>
