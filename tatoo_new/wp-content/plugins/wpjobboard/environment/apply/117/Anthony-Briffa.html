        <strong>Good around artists </strong>
        <i>Hi my name is Anthony Briffa,I&#039;m looking to get back in a shop.
I’m a very determent person and have pride in every job that I do. The passion for tattoo came from when I was young always drawing on paper and done my first tattoo when I was 14 sitting in school it was a small devil that my father didn’t agree at all with the piece and got it half removed but that didn’t really stop me kept on experimenting until I meet an artist that was willing to teach me, I done a year of apprentice in a shop in Corydon U.K, where I kept on learning about the art and got my certificate as a tattoo artist. But after my few years as a tattoo artist in Croydn my time got cut short as my mother fell ill and I had to come back to Malta. So I move back to Malta and kept on working in a studio that I’ve crated in my house over here.
 Malta is a very small country and I feel that there is too many artists over here. I’m now ready to move again as long that it is in shop so I can keep on growing in the industry that I really love. I crated a small portfolio of the stuff that I been doing lately on this site the user name is zimbatattoo, I hope that you will enjoy looking at my work. 
Thank you for your time would you want to know anything more about me, I will be happy to answer your questions on my email briffa2@gmail.com . Thank you again and hope to hear from you soon.
Anthony Briffa.
