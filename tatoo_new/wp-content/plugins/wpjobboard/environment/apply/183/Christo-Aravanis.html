        <strong>&quot;...and I know that you will be  to hear that I have chosen you as my employer. Period and paragraph&quot;</strong>
        <i>Photoshop PRO. No understatement there. I produce the highest level of linework and reference images available to man, its all about the graphics tablet. Pencil work is quality and traced lines are better than your average too. Lots of work with copics, prismacolor pencils and faber-castell pens.

The whole process from start to finish is my forte.

&quot;I am willing to go to work for you under the following conditions; I will work for the first 3 months, and PAY YOU a salary of any amount you name per month for that privilege, with the understanding that if at the end of those three months you wish to continue my services you pay me that same salary, but meanwhile you&#039;ll allow me to put on the cuff what I&#039;ll owe you, and you can take it out of what you&#039;ll owe me if you continue my services&quot; (Napoleon Hill)

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <div class="wpjb-job-text">July 2008 till present @ Station Tattoo Studio (Leeds, UK)<br />
Station Tattoo has been a vital experience and sandbox that has allowed me to develop key design skills and creativity. Since my father established the studio, I have worked alongside him as the Creative Director. We have thrived as a synchronous father and son team, in which I manage all the design work, promotional and marketing areas, and my father does the tattooing. I feel I have flair and confidence with customers and I have become an expert at consulting clients and working with them to realize a finalised design. In these years, my artist ability and skill is ever-increasing and I have become a self-dependable artist creating a vast amount of bespoke tattoo designs. <br />
