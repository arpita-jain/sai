        <i>I can draw free hand tribal and like to design drawings for customers and there&#039;s  nothing wrong to do new things, and you never to old to learn new art or new things. I like new challenges. My goal in life is to learn more and to work hard. I love what I am doing and to keep my customers happy. Like to do skulls and things that have a lot of detail and like to play with colour.
